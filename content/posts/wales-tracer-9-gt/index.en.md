### The story

The night before, we slept early, ready for the next adventurous morning. The luggage was packed, except for some items we would use in the morning.
We set the alarm for 7:00, but we snoozed it till 7:30. <br>

Visiting the countryside of the UK is different from most. My wife, Beatriz, and I were getting ready for four days long weekend adventure. All the way up to Wales and back. Going through valleys and mountains and enjoying the beautiful scenery.

At around 8:00, we were both ready. All dressed up for a long journey and ready to hit the road. The next stop was the [SIFT Bakes & Brews](https://www.siftcakes.co.uk/) for a nice coffee and a pastry. I did the same last year when I went to Wales, and I was not disappointed. The coffee was great, and the pastry was delicious. I had a chocolate croissant, and my wife had a blueberry muffin. We both enjoyed it.<br>
Helmets on, sync the audio and go. It took us about one hour and fifteen minutes to arrive at our next destination. [The Pig Place](https://thepigplace.co.uk/) is a great and different canalside camping and farm shop with a cafe serving breakfast and lunch. We grabbed a coffee and an egg and bacon sandwich. The coffee was great, and the sandwich was delicious. Beatriz, My wide, was enjoying a nice vegetarian breakfast. With a nice cup of coffee next to the canal. <br>
After about 30 minutes, we started heading to our next destination; unsure where that was, we followed the GPS. We were heading to [Rustic Green Shepherds Hut under the Wenlock Edge](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/602604607035936002?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=b7c7491c-5881-4df7-9d47-9c0f8cd535e9). We were not sure if we would make it before dark, but we were not in a hurry. We enjoyed the ride and the beautiful scenery. We were heading to the [Wenlock Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenlock_Edge), a 40-mile (64 km) long escarpment in Shropshire, England. The edge is formed by the Wenlock Limestone Formation, which is part of the Silurian Wenlock Series. The edge is a popular area for walkers and cyclists and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). <br>
My wife was getting tired at around two o'clock, so we stopped for a break. We found a nice spot, and we had a nice break. We had a nice cup of tea and a nice sandwich. We were both feeling better. We found ourselves in a small ancient market town situated northwest of Worcestershire on the A456 road. Tenbury Wells is a small town with a population of about 3,000. It is a popular tourist destination with several attractions, including the Tenbury Museum, the Tenbury Pump Room, and the Tenbury Wells Golf Club. <br>
We stopped, parked the motorbike at the local parking and headed to the closest cafe. [Mr Thoms](www.Mr-Thoms-finest-handmade-chocolate.myshopify.com) is a lovely place to have a nice cup of tea and a nice sandwich. It is also a great place to get some handmade crafted Belgian chocolate.
Finishing our lunch, at around four, two hours later, we start heading towards our accommodation for the night.<br>
Next stop, the [Rustic Green Shepherds Hut under the Wenlock Edge](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/602604607035936002?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=b7c7491c-5881-4df7-9d47-9c0f8cd535e9). We were there by five. We were both tired, and we were both hungry. We had a nice diner from the local petrol station and a couple of beers, and we headed to sleep early. <br>
