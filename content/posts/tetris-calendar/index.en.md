I'd like to thank Tetris for making me really good at scheduling my meetings.

> The worst part about going to meetings is that they interrupt what could otherwise be productive work time, and it takes a long time to get back in the groove of what you were doing.

# The problem
It's Monday morning, and you just woke up with that feeling of dread of going to work and starting your workweek. <br>
Coffee is brewing, you are getting ready for work, and you are thinking about the meetings you have to attend today. <br>

Log in to your calendar, and you will see that you have nine meetings today.
Most of them are 30 minutes long, but some are 1 hour long.
Some are part of your lunch. Great, you have to eat your lunch in front of your computer. <br>


Following that day of 16 March 2020, when the world changed, I started working from home.
Now meetings are a part of my daily life.
I have to attend meetings, I have to schedule meetings, and I have to reschedule meetings. <br>

I have to do all this while trying to be productive and finish my work. <br>
<!-- mention mental health -->

In the old days, having a coffee with a colleague was a great way to get to know each other better, break the day, and have a Monday rant before you had to attend this important meeting. <br>
Not anymore; all the meetings are online, and all are important. Each and every one of them. All nine.



## Meeting FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

One of the most common reasons we attend too many meetings is [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), or Fear of Missing Out. As meeting participants, we worry that our colleagues will judge us — or worse yet, forget about us — if we don't accept every invitation.

>The Oxford Dictionaries online defines the fear of missing out as <br>
> **""Anxiety that an exciting or interesting event may currently be happening elsewhere, often aroused by posts seen on a social media website.""**

The concept originated early this century alongside the rise of social media, which opened windows into lives everywhere. FOMO is also the subject of at [least three](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fear-of-missing-out-life-dissatisfaction-fomo_n_3275349) studies, establishing it as a concrete psychological phenomenon in the **Age of Information**. The popular podcast [Note to Self](https://open.spotify.com/show/59VYjQEEd5dWljjEtikoCx?si=1528031414cc4a81) even dedicated an entire episode to it.



# The solution

What do you really need to do to get your work done? Which meetings are essential?

Most times, you can **bundle meetings**. And reject the ones that are not important. <br>
Choose to send a slack message instead of scheduling a meeting. It's faster and more efficient.

Does the meeting really need to be **1 hour long?** Can you make it 30 minutes? What about 20 minutes? <br>
Most meetings are lengthy because they need to be better prepared. Meeting with an agenda is a good use of time. Most times going to a meeting is to address a specific issue.
Without an agenda, the meeting will take longer or be less productive by discussing other topics.

Do you need a **recurring meeting?** Can you make it a weekly meeting? <br>
Some meetings are recurring, yet nothing is to be discussed. Ask yourself if you really need to attend that meeting every week. Ask the organizer if you can make it a monthly meeting.

The -10 minutes rule. <br>
If a meeting is **60 minutes long**, you can **make it 50** minutes long. <br> save those 10 mins for a cup of water and for some time to absorb what was discussed.
If a meeting is 30 minutes long, you can make it 20 minutes long, etc. <br>
