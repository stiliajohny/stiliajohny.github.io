How to improve your team's incident management process by embracing more incidents.

<!--more-->

## Introduction:

Infrastructure incidents, such as network outages or data breaches, are often viewed as negative events that should be avoided at all costs. However, this perspective ignores the fact that infrastructure incidents can also be valuable learning opportunities. By actively managing and learning from infrastructure incidents, organizations can improve the reliability and efficiency of their systems and processes, and ultimately build stronger, more resilient infrastructure. In this article, we will explore the benefits of embracing infrastructure incidents as opportunities for growth and improvement, and discuss the dangers of avoiding or hiding infrastructure incidents.

### Definition of "infrastructure incident"

An infrastructure incident is an event or series of events that disrupts or has the potential to disrupt the operation of an organization's infrastructure, which refers to the underlying systems, processes, and technologies that support the organization's operations. Infrastructure incidents can include things like network outages, data breaches, server failures, and other disruptions to the availability, security, or performance of the organization's infrastructure. The impact of an infrastructure incident can range from minor inconvenience to significant disruption of business operations, depending on the severity of the incident and the organization's preparedness to respond.

### The common tendency to view infrastructure incidents as negative events

It is common for organizations to view infrastructure incidents as negative events because they can cause disruptions to business operations and can have negative impacts on customers and stakeholders. Infrastructure incidents can lead to lost productivity, revenue, and customer trust, and can also damage an organization's reputation. As a result, it is natural for organizations to prioritize the prevention and minimization of infrastructure incidents, and to view them as negative events that should be avoided if possible. However, it is important for organizations to also recognize that infrastructure incidents can be valuable learning opportunities, and that embracing and managing infrastructure incidents proactively can ultimately lead to stronger, more resilient infrastructure and a more robust organization overall.

### The purpose of the article: to argue that more infrastructure incidents can be beneficial

The purpose of an article that argues that more infrastructure incidents can be beneficial would be to challenge the common perspective that views infrastructure incidents as negative events that should be avoided at all costs. The article could present evidence and arguments to support the idea that, rather than being something to be feared, infrastructure incidents can be valuable learning opportunities that can help organizations improve their infrastructure and operations. The article might highlight the benefits of actively managing and learning from infrastructure incidents, such as the opportunity to identify and fix problems before they become more serious, the potential for improving efficiency and reliability through incident-driven optimization, and the opportunity to build stronger, more resilient infrastructure through proactive incident management. The article could also discuss the dangers of avoiding or hiding infrastructure incidents, and the importance of transparency in incident management.

## The benefits of learning from infrastructure incidents:

- Identifying and fixing problems: Infrastructure incidents can reveal weaknesses in systems and processes that may not have been apparent otherwise. By actively managing and learning from these incidents, organizations can identify and fix problems before they become more serious.

### The potential for improving efficiency and reliability through incident-driven optimization

Incident-driven optimization refers to the process of using infrastructure incidents as opportunities to improve the efficiency and reliability of systems and processes. When an incident occurs, it can reveal bottlenecks or inefficiencies in systems and processes that may not have been apparent otherwise. By actively managing and learning from these incidents, organizations can identify and address these issues, resulting in improved efficiency and reliability.

For example, if an incident is caused by a system being overloaded, the organization could optimize the system by improving its performance or capacity, or by implementing load balancing to distribute traffic more evenly across multiple servers. By addressing the root cause of the incident, the organization can improve the overall performance and reliability of the system.

Incident-driven optimization can also involve implementing new processes or technologies to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. For example, if an incident is caused by a security vulnerability, the organization could implement new security measures or update its security protocols to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

Overall, incident-driven optimization can help organizations improve the efficiency and reliability of their systems and processes, leading to better performance and a stronger, more resilient infrastructure.

## The dangers of avoiding or hiding infrastructure incidents:

- Risks of ignoring or downplaying incidents: By avoiding or downplaying infrastructure incidents, organizations risk ignoring or failing to address underlying problems that could lead to more serious disruptions or problems in the future. This can be particularly dangerous if the incident reveals a weakness or vulnerability that needs to be addressed to prevent future incidents.
- Consequences of a culture of blame and secrecy: A tendency to avoid or hide infrastructure incidents can create a culture of blame and secrecy, which can discourage transparency and hinder the organization's ability to learn from and improve upon incidents. This can lead to a lack of accountability and a lack of progress in improving systems and processes.
- Negative impacts on customer trust and loyalty: Infrastructure incidents can have negative impacts on customer trust and loyalty, particularly if they are not addressed transparently and effectively. By avoiding or hiding incidents, organizations risk damaging their reputation and losing the trust of their customers. This can be particularly damaging in the aftermath of a significant incident.
